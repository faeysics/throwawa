# throwawa

This is my "i don't want to mess up my actual mod and accidentally never be able to recover it so I'll practice first in a throw away" mod

Generally I just restart with A Triangle's tutorial data pack because somehow I made an alteration and everything went wrong 
so I just take that one and change one thing until i get it right
